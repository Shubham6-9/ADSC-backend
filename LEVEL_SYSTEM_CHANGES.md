# Level System Changes - Summary

## Problem Statement
Previously, when an admin created or updated a level configuration, the `xpForNextLevel` field in user documents wasn't properly reflecting the XP requirements. The system was updating users at the wrong level.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes:

1. **Fixed Level Sync Logic** (`services/levelSync.service.js`)
   - **Before**: Updated users at the specified level
   - **After**: Updates users at (level - 1) 
   - **Reason**: If admin sets Level 2 to require 200 XP, users at Level 1 need to know their next level requires 200 XP

2. **Auto-Sync on Level Creation/Update** (`controllers/levelConfig.controller.js`)
   - Changed `syncExisting` default from `false` to `true`
   - Now automatically syncs affected users when admin creates/updates a level
   - Also re-evaluates users at the previous level to check if they can now level up

3. **Created Helper Service** (`services/getXpForNextLevel.service.js`)
   - Centralized function to get XP required for next level
   - Takes current level as input, returns XP required for (current level + 1)
   - Used across signup and re-evaluation processes

4. **Updated User Signup** (`controllers/auth.controller.js`)
   - New users now get proper `xpForNextLevel` from Level 2 config
   - Falls back to environment variable if no config exists

5. **Updated Re-evaluation Service** (`services/reevalUsers.service.js`)
   - Now uses the helper to properly set `xpForNextLevel` after level changes

## How It Works Now

### Example Scenario:
1. Admin creates Level 1 with 100 XP required
2. Admin creates Level 2 with 200 XP required
   - System automatically updates all users at Level 1 to have `xpForNextLevel = 200`
3. User signs up:
   - Starts at Level 1 with 0 XP
   - `xpForNextLevel` is automatically set to 200 (from Level 2 config)
4. User gains XP and reaches 200:
   - System levels them up to Level 2
   - `xpForNextLevel` updates to Level 3's requirement (if it exists)

## API Usage

### Create/Update Level (Automatically syncs users)
```json
POST /api/levels
{
  "level": 2,
  "xpRequired": 200,
  "syncExisting": true  // optional, defaults to true
}
```

Response includes:
- `syncResult`: How many users at (level - 1) were updated
- `reevalResult`: How many users were re-evaluated for level ups

### Benefits:
✅ No more manual database cleanup
✅ User XP progression always reflects current level configs
✅ Admins can safely update level requirements
✅ New users automatically get correct XP targets
✅ Existing users auto-sync when levels change
